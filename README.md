Boordle is a minigame I encountered in the game [Crank It! by James Dornan & Mike Klunbnika](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/crank-it).  
It wasn't the first time I encountered it, but in a high stress situation it can be a tricky one to figure out.

So I made a separate mini game to practice, as well as a solver if you really get stuck!

If you want to build it yourself you'll need Node 22.  
Just run `npm install` and `npm start` to host the website locally.
